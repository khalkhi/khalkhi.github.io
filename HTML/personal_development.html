<h4><u>My Personal Strenghts</u></h4>
		<br>
		
		</br>
	<ol>

		<li>Courage-<q>Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.</q>
			(Winston Churchill).I practice to have Hope in most situations,I stay confident that one way or another
			things <b>WILL</b> and <b>MUST</b> work out.I train myself to accept the reality of most things so that I
			am not easily devastated.I accept that I am not in control of things because I understand that 
			life is a series of fortunate and unfortunate events where I don't always get what I want or need. </br>
		</br>

		<li>Temperance- I see myself as a person who is very thoughtful and not too emotional or too detached. 
						Wants nothing more than to make themselves better.Can manage to be soft but also to be hard.
						I try to be the best of myself even in the worst of situations.I try to be forgiving and understanding in most 
						situations even tho it is mostly taken advantage of.
		<br>
	</br>
		
		</br>
			
		<li>Wisdom- I am the someone who dertermins my own reality,
					I am able to entertain other persons thoughts or views without being persuaded into thinking that it's 
					my own. A wise man once said <q><blockquote>A fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool</blockquote></q>.

	<h4><u>Twelve Pillars Summary</u></h4>
	<p>
			Chapter 4,Charlie urges Michael to list his objectives. because Michael was dissatisfied with his current place in his industry.
		Charlie went on to explain to him that he should set goals that will push him and make him think differently in order to get where he 
		wants to go in the future he wants. He divides it into little pieces so Michael can distinguish between long term and short term objectives.
		<br>
		</br>
		<ul>
			<li>I think setting goals to accomplish in life will give you something to live for, something to drive and motivate you into becoming a top acheiver.
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>	
			Chapter 5, Charlie discusses to Michael the value of his goals and the need to steer clear of regrets. Charlie clarifies the issue by 
		contrasting the pain of regret with the pain of discipline. Then he advised Michael to make the most of each day because there is just one finest
		opportunity out of all the opportunities that come along. And cautioned him against making the mistake of prioritizing urgent over important tasks
		when managing his time. Michael was even told to establish his own life plans rather than adopting others'.
		<br>
		</br>
		<ul>
			<li> Every positive opportunity that shows itself in life we should try and gravitate to it. People often miss great opportunities because of shyness
			or because of fear, but every positive opportunity is a chance to further develop our lives.
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
			 Chapter 6, Charlie emphasized to Michael the value of associating with upbeat individuals rather to those who are continually whining about 
		their circumstances and doing nothing to change it. If you want to be successful, surround yourself with successful people. When you are around 
		your friends, family, coworkers, and other people, you should feel empowered to make any improvements to your life that you can.
		<br>
		</br>
		<ul>
			<li>People you associate with around can really determine the type of person you come out to be. There is a quote that says<q>Show me your
		friends and I will tell you who you are</q>. It is always best to stick around positive and hardworking individuals because they can guide 
		you to a bright future
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
			 Chapter 7, Charlie emphasized the value of lifelong learning in order to advance and thrive. It states that your success in life is not guaranteed by 
		your formal education. Three methods for keeping learning active are reading books to be exposed to new ideas, ways of thinking, and cultures, watching 
		successful individuals, and reflecting on and learning from	your own experiences.
		<br>
		</br>
		<ul>
			<li>In everyday life we live we learn new stuff. Whether by heartbreak, love, discipline or simply even having a conversation. It is always best to keep on 
			expanding your knowlege so you can develop new skills, habits and even new traits.
		</ul>
